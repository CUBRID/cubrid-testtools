# Test Objective
SQL is basic but important feature of one RDBMS product. CUBRID as a comprehensive relational database management system supports not only standard SQL but also native extension.  
In order to test SQL feature, we designed two suites SQL and MEDIUM which include all kinds of DDL, DML and so on.  
Typically, SQL and MEDIUM perform tests via JDBC interface on both Linux and Windows platform as regression test. And we also introduce SQL_BY_CCI suite which execute SQL test cases via CCI interface. In this guide, I would introduce SQL, MEDIUM and SQL_BY_CCI tests.  
  
# General SQL Test  
## Test deployment  
* Install CTP  
Please follow guides to [install CTP on Linux platform](https://github.com/CUBRID/cubrid-testtools/blob/develop/doc/ctp_install_guide.md#1-install-ctp-in-linux-platform) or [install CTP on Windows platform](https://github.com/CUBRID/cubrid-testtools/blob/develop/doc/ctp_install_guide.md#2-install-ctp-in-windows-platform).
    * SQL test  
    Prepare test configuration file ~/CTP/conf/sql.conf    
	    ```

	* SQL_BY_CCI test  
    touch and configure ~/CTP/conf/sql_by_cci_template.conf  
	Add cci configuration "sql_interface_type=cci" to sql.conf
    * Windows test  
    touch and configure ~/CTP/conf/sql.conf   
	Modify configuration "jdbc_config_file=test_default.xml" to "jdbc_config_file = test_win.xml","ha_mode=no" to "ha_mode=yes" in sql.conf 
* configure ~/.bash_profile
    ```
    export TZ='Asia/Seoul'
	export LC_ALL=en_US
    ```
    source ~/.bash_profile
* Install CUBRID  
On Linux systems,use the sh installation file to install cubrid.  
    ```
    sh CUBRID-10.2.0.8414-294c026-Linux.x86_64-debug.sh
    ```
On Windows systems,use the msi installation file to install cubrid for the first time.  
* Check out test cases  
    ```
    cd ~  
    git clone https://github.com/CUBRID/cubrid-testcases.git 
    ```
     Itâ€˜s difference between SQL and MEDIUM,  there is a unload file cubrid-testcases/medium/files/mdb.tar.gz that is used to MEDIUM test.(The files mdb_indexes,mdb_schema and mdb_objects are in the mdb.tar.gz archive)
    * MEDIUM test
        ```
        cubrid createdb testdb en_US  
        cubrid loaddb -u dba -d mdb_objects -s mdb_schema -i mdb_indexes  testdb
        ```

## Executed Test
### CTP  
* Execute with interactive mode via CTP  
run ctp.sh  
  Modify the working directory and configuration parameters in the file CTP/conf/sql.conf:scenario=${HOME}/cubrid-testcases/sql
  * SQL
    ```
    ctp.sh sql -c CTP/conf/sql.conf --interactive
    ```
  * MEDIUM
    ```
    ctp.sh medium -c CTP/conf/sql.conf --interactive
    ```
  * SQL_BY_CCI
    ```
    ctp.sh sql -c CTP/conf/sql.conf --interactive
    ```
* Execute each test suite via CTP   
run test
  ```
  ======================================  Welcome to Interactive Mode ======================================  
  Usage: 
      help         print the usage of interactive
      run <arg>    the path of case file to run
      run_cci <arg>    the path of case file to run_cci by cci driver
      quit         quit interactive mode 

  For example:
      run .                                                 #run the current directory cases
      run ./_001_primary_key/_002_uniq                      #run the cases which are based on the relative path
      run test.sql                                          #run the test.sql file
      run /home/user1/dailyqa/trunk/scenario/sql/_02_object #run the cases which are based on the absolute path
      run_cci ./_001_primary_key/_002_uniq                  #run the cases which are based on the relative path
      run_cci ./_001_primary_key/_002_uniq/test.sql         #run the cases file
  sql>run .
  ```

# Regression Test Sustaining  
* Daily regression test  
When the build server has a new build, a SQL test will be executed. If there is something wrong and need to run SQL test again, you can send a test message.   
How to view qahome results:  
Go to QA homepage and click the CI build, wait for the page loading, then click the 'Function',look at the case of Fail  
![qa_result](./sql_image/qa_result.png)

* Code coverage test  
	* VERIFY CODE COVERAGE TESTING RESULT  
	Go to QA homepage and find the â€˜code coverageâ€™ node in the left area, click the link of latest result.  
	![coverage](./sql_image/coverage.png)  
	Click the Category(SQL,MEDIUM,SQL_BY_CCI) link.   
	![category](./sql_image/category.png)  
	There is a coverage rate of lines. Its SQL and SQL_BY_CCI coverage rate of lines is usually in 58%~60%, the MEDIUM coverage rate of lines is usually in 30%~31%.

	It is also necessary to add this information in the comment to facilitate the developers to find the information they need. Note that choose Restricted to Developers since they have they contain sensitive information such as IP, port, password, etc..  
* how to verify issue?  
	```
	Test Build: 10.2.0.8239-1f051a0 debug
	Test OS: Linux 64bit
	Test Result: Pass.
	Add test case for this issue: 

	Close this issue.
	```
# Test Case Specification  
* When add a test case for a bug fix, add a case to path  
	cubrid-testcases/sql/_13_issues/_{yy}_{1|2}h/cases with naming rules:  
	    cbrd_xxxxx.sql  
	    cbrd_xxxxx_1.sql  
	    cbrd_xxxxx_2.sql  
	    cbrd_xxxxx_xasl.sql  


* When add a test case for a feature test, add a case to path  
	cubrid-testcases/sql/_{no}_{release_code}/cbrd_xxxxx_{feature}/cases with naming rules:   
	    {any_structured_name}.sql

* How to make a SQL test case  
	A SQL test cases follows following basic structure:  
	any_testcase_folder/cases/case_file.sql  
	any_testcase_folder/answers/case_file.answer  
	any_testcase_folder/answers/case_file.answer_WIN (If the answers are different in Windows)  
	any_testcase_folder/answers/case_file.answer_cci (If the answers are different in CCI)  
  
	A SQL file goes to 'cases' folder, an answer file goes to 'answers' folder, and they should be in the same folder.The test case and answer should have the same name.
 
* Notes for writing case:  
  * CREATE TABLE should be preceded by DROP TABLE if exists.  
    drop table if exists t1;  
  * All schema objects created should be dropped.  
  * All session variables created should be dropped.  
  * All system parameters should be reset as default  
  We need to restore the system parameters after the test, so as not to affect other test execution   
  * Add ORDER BY for a select statement to make result stable.  
  * Answer should be stable.  
  * Don't write too much queries in one test case file, it's hard to verify when the case fails. You can separate them into several files.  
  * Avoid time-consuming queries.  
  * If need to print a query plan, add '--@queryplan' in front of the query. Or add an empty file like below:  
    /path/to/cases/case_file.sql  
    /path/to/cases/case_file.queryPlan  (make sure to output query plan info)  
    ![queryplan](./sql_image/queryplan.png)
