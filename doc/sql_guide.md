# SQL Test Guide

# 1. Test Objective
SQL is basic but important feature of one RDBMS product. CUBRID as a comprehensive relational database management system supports not only standard SQL but also native extension.  
In order to test SQL feature, we designed two suites SQL and MEDIUM which include all kinds of DDL, DML and so on.  
Typically, SQL and MEDIUM perform tests via JDBC interface on both Linux and Windows platform as regression test. And we also introduce SQL_BY_CCI suite which execute SQL test cases via CCI interface. In this guide, I would introduce SQL, MEDIUM and SQL_BY_CCI tests.  
  
# 2. General SQL Test  
## 2.1 SQL Test  
* Step 1: Install CTP  
Please follow guides to [install CTP on Linux platform](https://github.com/CUBRID/cubrid-testtools/blob/develop/doc/ctp_install_guide.md#1-install-ctp-in-linux-platform) or [install CTP on Windows platform](https://github.com/CUBRID/cubrid-testtools/blob/develop/doc/ctp_install_guide.md#2-install-ctp-in-windows-platform).
* Step 2: Install CUBRID  
  We prepare to test CUBRID. Please follow its guide to install CUBRID.
  Suppose that you install CUBRID as $HOME/CUBRID

  Add to `.bash_profile`:
    ```
    . .cubrid.sh 
    ```    
* Step 3: Test configuration:  
  Prepare test configuration file ~/CTP/conf/sql.conf

  Add below to .bash_profile: 
  ``` 
  export TZ='Asia/Seoul'
  export LC_ALL=en_US
  ``` 
  Note: Time zone `Asia/Seoul` is requried by test cases.
* Step 4: Check out test cases
  ```
  cd ~/
  git clone https://github.com/CUBRID/cubrid-testcases.git 
  cd cubrid-testcases
  git checkout develop  
  ```
* Step 5: Run test
  ```
  ctp.sh sql -c ~/CTP/conf/sql.conf
  ```
* Step 6: Examine test result
  * When the test is completed, CTP will print the summary result message, please see the example of SQL result for reference
	```
	-----------------------
	Fail:0
	Success:1
	Total:1
	Elapse Time:193
	Test Result Directory:/home/user/CTP/sql/result/y2016/m3schedule_linux_sql_64bit_24202122_10.0.0_1376

	-----------------------

	-----------------------
	Testing End!
	-----------------------
	```
  * Alternatively, you can use the webconsole of CTP to check results(the current webconsole feature only support SQL and MEDIUM)  
    ```
    $ bin/ctp.sh webconsole start
    Config: /home/user/CTP/conf/webconsole.conf
    Web Root: /home/user/CTP/sql/webconsole
    Begin to start ...
        
    Done
    URL:  http://127.0.0.1:8888
    ```  
    Please open the ``URL`` with your browser to see the details  
    ![ctp_web_result](./sql_image/ctp_web_result.png)  
## 2.2 MEDIUM Test 
  MEDIUM test is similar to [SQL test](#21-sql-test) except that MEDIUM database is loaded from a backuped files.  
  Let's prepare MEDIUM config file ~/CTP/conf/medium.conf which copy from SQL config file.   
  ```
  cp ~/CTP/conf/sql.conf ~/CTP/conf/medium.conf  
  ```
  Then change parameters as below:  
  ```
  [sql] 
  ...
  scenario=${HOME}/cubrid-testcases/medium
  data_file=${HOME}/cubrid-testcases/medium/files/mdb.tar.gz
  ...
  ```

  Then start MEDIUM test:
  ```
  ctp.sh sql -c ~/CTP/conf/medium.conf
  ```
  Other steps are same as SQL test.
## 2.3 SQL_BY_CCI Test  
  SQL_BY_CCI test is similar to [SQL test](#21-sql-test). 
  ```
  cp ~/CTP/conf/sql.conf ~/CTP/conf/sql_by_cci.conf  
  ```
  Then change file sql_by_cci.conf:  
  ```
  [sql]
  ...
  sql_interface_type=cci
  ...
  ```

  Then start SQL_BY_CCI test:
  ```
  ctp.sh sql -c ~/CTP/conf/sql_by_cci.conf
  ```
  How to examine sql_by_cci test result?  
  After `run_cci /path/to/cases/xxx.sql`, path/to/cases/xxx.result will be generated. You can confirm test case result by comparing the answer file and result file.  
  ```
  diff XXX/cases/XXX.result  XXX/answers/XXX.answer
  ```
  Other steps are same as SQL test.
## 2.4 SQL and MEDIUM tests on Windows platform
  Windows test is similar to [SQL test](#21-sql-test).  
  Change parameters as below: 
  ```
  [sql]
  ...
  jdbc_config_file = test_win.xml
  [sql/cubrid.conf]
  ...
  ha_mode=no  
  [sql/cubrid_ha.conf]
  ...
  ha_mode=no
  ...
  ```
  Other steps are same as SQL test.
## 2.5 Execute Test with interactive mode
  Option `--interactive` can be used to enable interactive mode execution in CTP.
  With this option, we may execute one sql file or a batch of sql files in a folder.
  ```
  ctp.sh sql -c CTP/conf/sql.conf --interactive
  ```
  ```
  ======================================  Welcome to Interactive Mode ======================================  
  Usage: 
      help         print the usage of interactive
      run <arg>    the path of case file to run
      run_cci <arg>    the path of case file to run_cci by cci driver
      quit         quit interactive mode 

  For example:
      run .                                                 #run the current directory cases
      run ./_001_primary_key/_002_uniq                      #run the cases which are based on the relative path
      run test.sql                                          #run the test.sql file
      run /home/user1/dailyqa/trunk/scenario/sql/_02_object #run the cases which are based on the absolute path
      run_cci ./_001_primary_key/_002_uniq                  #run the cases which are based on the relative path
      run_cci ./_001_primary_key/_002_uniq/test.sql         #run the cases file
  sql>run .
  ```

# 4. Regression Test Sustaining  
## 4.1 Execute Test Manually  
* Send test message  
  When the build server has a new build, a SQL test will be executed. If there is something wrong and need to run SQL test again, you can send a test message.  
  Login message@192.168.1.91 and send test message like:  
  * Test with debug build on Linux
    ```
    sender.sh QUEUE_CUBRID_QA_SQL_LINUX_GIT <build_url> sql_debug default
    sender.sh QUEUE_CUBRID_QA_SQL_LINUX_GIT <build_url> medium_debug default
    ```
  * Test message with release build on Linux
    ```
    sender.sh QUEUE_CUBRID_QA_SQL_PERF_LINUX <build_url> sql default
    sender.sh QUEUE_CUBRID_QA_SQL_PERF_LINUX <build_url> medium default
    sender.sh QUEUE_CUBRID_QA_SQL_CCI_LINUX_GIT <build_url> sql_by_cci default
    ```
  * Test message on Windows
    ```
    sender.sh QUEUE_CUBRID_QA_SQL_WIN64 <build_url> sql default
    sender.sh QUEUE_CUBRID_QA_SQL_WIN64 <build_url> medium default
    ```
   _build_url_: provide a build URL like `http://192.168.1.91:8080/REPO_ROOT/store_01/10.2.0.8369-5a75e41/drop/CUBRID-10.2.0.8369-5a75e41-Linux.x86_64-debug.sh`.  
## 4.2 Verify Test Results
* Check if there is test result  
Open [QA home](http://qahome.cubrid.org), navigate to find test result as below. If there is no any result, you need to find the reason out.   
![qa_result](./sql_image/qa_result1.png)  
![qa_result](./sql_image/qa_result1_1.png)  
* Test Rate should be 100%
It means the `Testing` is equal to the sum of `Success` and `Fail` (Total).     
![qa_result](./sql_image/qa_result2.png)
* Verified Rate should be 100%  
The verified rate should be 100% as below.   
![qa_result](./sql_image/qa_result3.png)  
If there is a failed test case, you need to verify it following below:  
![qa_result](./sql_image/qa_result4.png)  
Note:  
New issues : It is link to a jira issue which reported by this case  
Revise required issues: It is link to a jira issue which lead to change in test case and answer  
## 4.3 Code Coverage Test 
* Send Code Coverage Testing Message  
  Login message@192.168.1.91 and send test message like:  
  ```
  sh sender_code_coverage_testing_message.sh <queue_name> <build_url> <build_source_url>  
  ```
  eg:
  ```
  cd manual
  sh  sender_code_coverage_testing_message.sh QUEUE_CUBRID_QA_SQL_LINUX_GIT  http:/192.168.1.91:8080/REPO_ROOT/store_01/10.2.0.8270-c897055/dropCUBRID-10.2.0.8270-c897055-gcov-Linux.x86_64.tar.gz http://192.168.1.91:8080/REPO_ROOTstore_01/10.2.0.8270-c897055/drop/cubrid-10.2.0.8270-c897055-gcov-src-Linux.x86_64.tar.gz  sql
  ```  
* Verify Code Coverage Testing Result  
	Go to QA homepage and find the ‘code coverage’ node in the left area, click the link of latest result.  
	![coverage](./sql_image/coverage.png)  
	Click related category (sql, medium or sql_by_cci) link.     
	![category](./sql_image/category.png)  
	There is a coverage rate by line.  Acceptable code coverage rate of SQL is nearly greater than 59%. For MEDIUM, it is 31%.  
	![coverage_result](./sql_image/coverage_result.png)
# 5. How to make a SQL test case  
* A SQL test cases follows following basic structure:  
	any_testcase_folder/cases/case_file.sql  
	any_testcase_folder/answers/case_file.answer  
	any_testcase_folder/answers/case_file.answer_WIN (If the answers are different in Windows)  
	any_testcase_folder/answers/case_file.answer_cci (If the answers are different in CCI)    
	A SQL file goes to 'cases' folder, an answer file goes to 'answers' folder, and they should be in the same folder.  
  The test case and answer should have the same name.  
* When add a test case for a bug fix, add a case to path  
	cubrid-testcases/sql/_13_issues/_{yy}_{1|2}h/cases with naming rules:  
	    cbrd_xxxxx.sql  
	    cbrd_xxxxx_1.sql  
	    cbrd_xxxxx_2.sql  
	    cbrd_xxxxx_xasl.sql  


* When add a test case for a feature test, add a case to path  
	cubrid-testcases/sql/_{no}_{release_code}/cbrd_xxxxx_{feature}/cases with naming rules:   
	    {any_structured_name}.sql

* To make an answer file, follow steps 1~9
  * step 1/9: run ctp.sh sql with interactive mode  
  ![step1](./sql_image/step1.png) 
  * step 2/9: wait for testing ready  
  ![step2](./sql_image/step2.png) 
  * step 3/9: change directory to test cases folder, touch an empty answer file, then run the test
case. The ctp.sh supports to run a single test case or a test case folder. Please read the
'Usage' and examples in the screen  
  ![step3](./sql_image/step3.png) 
  * step 4/9: check the result is correct. then copy it as answer. Please notice that before copying as answer,
please confirm query results one by one in sql file. Never submit incorrect answer.  
  ![step4](./sql_image/step4.png) 
  * step 5/9: run test case again and check the result is success.  
  ![step5](./sql_image/step5.png) 
  * step 6/9: run the test case using CCI by 'run_cci' command to check if there is a difference  
  ![step6](./sql_image/step6.png) 
  * step 7/9: If the result is failed and the different result is expected, then copy the result as a cci answer.  
    ```
    cp cbrd_22696.result ../answers/cbrd_22696.answer_cci
    ```
  * step 8/9: You also need to execute above steps in a Windows OS to check the test case is pass. If it has different result and it is expected, then add a windows answer as well.  
    ```
    cp cbrd_22696.result ../answers/cbrd_22696.answer_WIN 
    ```
  * step 9/9: commit the sql file and answer files to git repository.   
 
# 6. Test Case Specification  
  * CREATE TABLE should be preceded by DROP TABLE if exists.  
    drop table if exists t1;  
  * All schema objects created should be dropped.  
  * All session variables created should be dropped.  
  * All system parameters should be reset as default  
  We need to restore the system parameters after the test, so as not to affect other test execution   
  * Add ORDER BY for a select statement to make result stable.  
  * Answer should be stable.  
  * Don't write too much queries in one test case file, it's hard to verify when the case fails. You can separate them into several files.  
  * Avoid time-consuming queries.  
  * If need to print a query plan, add '--@queryplan' in front of the query. Or add an empty file like below:  
    /path/to/cases/case_file.sql  
    /path/to/cases/case_file.queryPlan  (make sure to output query plan info)  
    ![queryplan](./sql_image/queryplan.png)
