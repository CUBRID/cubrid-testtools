# 1. Test Objective

Code coverage is a measurement of how many lines/blocks/arcs of CUBRID code are executed while the automated tests are running. We use valgrind tool to instrument the binaries and run a full set of automated tests. Near all of existing test cases (SQL, MEDIUM, SQL_BY_CCI, HA_REPL, CCI, ISOLATION, SHELL, HA_SHELL, SHELL_HEAVY, SHELL_LONG, YCSB, SYSBENCH, TPC-W, TPC-C, DOTS) are used for code coverage test and scheduled by manual.
