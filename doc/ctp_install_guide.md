# CTP Installation Guide

## 1. Install CTP in Linux platform

* ### Step 1: Install Java

  Java 6 or higher version is required.

  After installation, environment veriables should be added to `.bash_profile`.

      export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk
      export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

* ### Step 2: Download and install CTP

  Download CTP and deploy it to path $HOME/CTP as below:

      cd ~
      git clone https://github.com/CUBRID/cubrid-testtools.git
      cd ~/cubrid-testtools 
      git checkout develop
      cp -rf CTP ~/

  Recommend to add it to environment variable `PATH` in `.bash_prfile`:

      export PATH=$HOME/CTP/bin:$HOME/CTP/common/script:$PATH

* ### Step 3: Show help to confirm result

      [fanzq@fmdev059 ~]$ ctp.sh -h
      Welcome to use CUBRID Test Program (CTP)
      usage: ctp.sh <sql|medium|shell|ha_repl|isolation|jdbc|unittest> -c
                    <config_file>
       -c,--config <arg>   provide a configuration file
       -h,--help           show help
          --interactive    interactive mode to run single test case or cases in
                           a folder
       -v,--version        show version

      utility: ctp.sh webconsole <start|stop>

      For example: 
              ctp.sh sql -c conf/sql.conf
              ctp.sh medium -c conf/medium.conf
              ctp.sh shell -c conf/shell.conf
              ctp.sh ha_repl -c conf/ha_repl.conf
              ctp.sh isolation -c conf/isolation.conf
              ctp.sh jdbc -c conf/jdbc.conf
              ctp.sh sql              #use default configuration file: /home/fanzq/CTP/conf/sql.conf
              ctp.sh medium           #use default configuration file: /home/fanzq/CTP/conf/medium.conf
              ctp.sh shell            #use default configuration file: /home/fanzq/CTP/conf/shell.conf
              ctp.sh ha_repl          #use default configuration file: /home/fanzq/CTP/conf/ha_repl.conf
              ctp.sh isolation                #use default configuration file: /home/fanzq/CTP/conf/isolation.conf
              ctp.sh jdbc             #use default configuration file: /home/fanzq/CTP/conf/jdbc.conf
              ctp.sh unittest #use default configuration file: /home/fanzq/CTP/conf/unittest.conf
              ctp.sh sql medium       #run both sql and medium with default configuration
              ctp.sh medium medium    #execute medium twice
              ctp.sh webconsole start #start web console to view sql test results

## 2. Install CTP in Windows platform  
* ### Install Visual Studio 2017  
    Visual Studio is required by  CUBRID/bin/make_locale.bat.  
    When install Visual Studio 2017, choose `Workloads` tab, in `Windows (3)` section, choose `Desktop development with C++`, then click `Install` or `Modify` to start the installation.  
    After installation, check system variable `VS140COMNTOOLS`   
  * If `VS140COMNTOOLS` is not added to the system variables automatically, please add it manually.  
    ```
    VS140COMNTOOLS=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft VisualStudio\2017\Community\Common7\Tools\    
    ``` 
* ### Install cygwin  
  * Required packages:  `wget`, `zip`, `unzip`, `dos2unix`, `bc`, `expect`.  
    Do not choose: `gcc` and `MinGW`  
  * Package versions required  
    Unsatisfied versions which will lead to many case failures:  
    ```
    grep: 3.0-2  
    gawk: 4.1.4-3  
    sed: 4.4-1  
    ```
    Satisfied versions:  
    ```
    gawk: 4.1.3-1  
    grep: 3.0-1  
    sed: 4.2.2-3  
    ```
    Please refer to appendix [How to install packages with customized version in cygwin](#how-to-install-packages-with-customized-version-in-cygwin).  
    * Note: why install the specific versions?  
        Take `'grep'` as an example:  
        We found, `'\r'` was appended in the texts on windows. By our investigation, we found information about it:
        >
        > This build modifies the behavior of grep to no longer force text mode on 
        > binary-mounted file descriptors.  Since this includes pipelines by 
        > default, this means that if you pipe text data through a pipeline (such 
        > as the output of a windows program), you may need to insert a call to 
        > d2u to sanitize your input before passing it to grep.  
        > 
        > Source: http://cygwin.1069669.n5.nabble.com/ANNOUNCEMENT-TEST-Cygwin-3-1-0-0-2-td147352.html

        We do not intend to modify test cases, since the cases are used by both linux and windows platform.  
        So we need to use `grep` before `'3.0-2'`.  
  * Change environment variable `PATH`  
    Add `'C:\cygwin64\bin'` in the `PATH`  
* ### Install git  
    Download git in https://git-for-windows.github.io/.  
    In the installation wizard, choose these options:  
    `Adjusting your PATH environment`, choose `Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt`  
    `Confifuring the line ending conversions`, choose `Checkout as-is, commit as-is`  
* ### Install CTP  
    Please follow the same steps as Linux platform to [install CTP](#1-install-ctp-in-linux-platform). 

## 3. Install CTP as Regression Test platform

  Follow above chapters to install CTP as general installation. Then let's continue to support regression test.

* ### Provide Common Configuration

    Common configuration will be used by many script files in CTP located in CTP/common/script.

    File ~/CTP/conf/common.conf:

      git_user=<git user>
      git_pwd=<git password>
      git_email=<email address>
      default_ssh_pwd=<password for ssh connect>

      mail_from_nickname=CUBRIDQA_BJ
      mail_from_address=dl_cubridqa_bj_internal@navercorp.com

* ### Add CTP environment variables  
    ```
    # CTP HOME
    export CTP_HOME=$HOME/CTP

    # Whether to update CTP when execute CTP/common/script/upgrade.sh. 
    export CTP_SKIP_UPDATE=0

    # Branch used when upgrade CTP
    export CTP_BRANCH_NAME=develop
    ```
# Appendix
* ### How to install packages with customized version in cygwin?

  There are two ways. Let's take `'grep'` as an example.
    
  * **The first way, install from internet**

    1. Start cygwin installation file `'setup-x86_64.exe'`
  
    2. In step `'Choose A Download Source'`, select `'Install from Internet'`
  
    3. In step `'Select Packages'`, in the field of `'View'`, choose `'Category'` or `'Full'`, and in the field of `'Search'`, input `'grep'`.  Then, find the line of `'grep: search for regular expression matches in test files'`. Click the column of `'New'` (the second column) on this line, until `'3.0-1'` appears.    
    
       (1) If `'3.0-1'` can be shown automatically, choose `'Pending'` in `'View'` field, to check the pending list is correct:   
          + This package is in the list  
          + If there are other packages which you do not want to update this time, please click the second columns of these lines on by one to mark them as `'keep'`.  
          + Note: check the pending list is important, since new versions of other packages are put in pending list and will be updated automatically. For example, last time, I reverted `'gawk'` to old version, and this time, I try to install old version of `'grep'` and forget to check the pending list, `'gawk'` will be updated to the newer version at this time.  So we'd better to install `'gawk'`, `'grep'`, `'sed'` at once, instead of install them separately.          
          
       (2) If `'3.0-1'` cannot be shown automatically, cancel this installation, and use the second installation method below.  
      
    4. Use the default options in the following steps  

  * **The second way, install from Local Directory**  
    When the required versions cannot be found in the first way, we need to install it from local directory.  
    
    1. Find your last dowload/installation path, like `'http%3a%2f%2fcygwin.mirror.constant.com%2f'`  
    
    2. Add the previous grep package in the installation path.  
      (1) download the previous package of `'grep'`         
      (2) put this package in the previous installation path
          e.g. `'C:\winshell_setup\http%3a%2f%2fcygwin.mirror.constant.com%2f\x86_64\release\grep'`  
      (3) edit the setup.ini file  
          e.g. `'C:\winshell_setup\http%3a%2f%2fcygwin.mirror.constant.com%2f\x86_64\setup.ini'`  
        Add a `'[prev]'` section for this previous pack in `'@ grep'` part. If it already exists, just ignore this step.  
        
            [prev]
            version: 3.0-1
            install: x86_64/release/grep/grep-3.0-1.tar.xz 361740 a34cf6fc689a62005f7a33287c86419d7a24d262f694489af0dc864affd031f61f9f15970f2f211f335aa7a0234211facf98cc76d83639c7c631ffe5386b00ac
            source: x86_64/release/grep/grep-3.0-1-src.tar.xz 1379944 9d7b08c7e21d0d5058faff728dc575aab95d8c0ab8f70897ff0b2910f32b7f8dd1cdab530564a2786ffb24f676fa16bf7a51d8e0fb1488d2971dcc1d1c443d99
              
    3. Start setup-x86_64.exe  
        (1) In step `'Choose A Download Source'`, choose `'Install from Local Directory'`  
        (2) In step `'Select Local Package Directory'`, specify the path as `'C:\winshell_setup\http%3a%2f%2fcygwin.mirror.constant.com%2f'`  
        (3) Use the default options in the following steps, until you met step `'Select Packages'`, choose the correct version of `grep`, in this case, I select `'3.0-1'`.  
        (4) Use the default options in the following steps.
